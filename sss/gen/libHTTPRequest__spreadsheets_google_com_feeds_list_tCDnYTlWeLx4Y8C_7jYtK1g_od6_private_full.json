First, the lather. I put a top grade on it although it did dry out a bit on my face after the first pass, but I corrected that easily with a few drops of water. Otherwise, it was thick and velvety and perfect! Turns out I've really been using a lot of water in my lathers. I started with a dry bowl and a mostly dry brush. I put enough water on the puck to cover the whole thing and really did some small swirling. Turned out perfectly! Secondly, I am starting to really understand what they mean by a light touch. With the proper angle and a light touch, the razor just glides over the face while still erasing the whiskers. I have what is probably the the closest shave I have ever had. I decided to shave WTG   StdP. I realized that one of the possible problems I might have been having is that I wasn't reducing enough during my first WTG pass and that, just because StdP is what works for me with a DE, there's no reason to think that that's what will work with a Str8. So, for a while now, I'll be going back to doing 4 passes. But, this shave has proven to me that it is possible to get BBS with a Str8 without going ATG. My right cheek is 4-way BBS as well as <i>parts of my neck!</i>. I did suffer 3 - that's <u>three</u> - slices, one of which wound up in a huge scab, for some reason. And I did have some razor burn around my neck because a) it's pretty tough to get the correct angle while shaving my neck and b) because of the previous point, I tend to be a bit more apprehensive and didn't have the light touch I was using on my cheeks. But, I am getting better at angling and stretching in order to get the neck whiskers in the correct direction. I'll really have to put that mirror up though. I keep having to lean into the sink to look at myself in the mirror. So, in summary: learning light touch and angling plus recapturing lathering knowledge.
