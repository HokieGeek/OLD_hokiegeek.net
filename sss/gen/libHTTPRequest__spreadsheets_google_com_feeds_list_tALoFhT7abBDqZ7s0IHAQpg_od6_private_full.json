I LOVE the look of this brush. It's gorgeous. It was pretty expensive, but considering it's handmade and such high quality badger, that's a good price. I loved feeling it on my face and it generated much more lather from the Very 'V' than the Semogue did. Awesome buy! <br/> Edit: As I used it more - and in comparison to my boars - I found it way too floppy! It was pretty much ineffective with the swirling motion and I was always forced to 'paint' the lather on.
