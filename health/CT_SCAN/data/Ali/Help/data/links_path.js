// Place this file in the "data" folder below the topic folder because that
// folder is the same in both portal and stand-alone doc. It's unique to each
// Project Template folder, so it can identify the path for each doc type 
// (portal and stand-alone).
// As alternative, could test to see if doc_map.js is in same folder as this 
// links_path.js. If it is, it's stand-alone doc. If it isn't, it's portal doc.
 
// "linksPath" is relative path to the linked files (scripts, styles, images).
// It's different for portal doc and stand-alone doc.
// It's used in HTML file <head> when linking to scripts and styles files, and
// within script files that link to external files such as images.
